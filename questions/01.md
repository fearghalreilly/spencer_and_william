Subject: Bad design

Hello,  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

Thank you for contacting Algolia.

My name is Fearghal and will be assisting you on your inquiry regarding the new dashboard design and how clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away.

Algolia supports alternative methods of deleting and clearing indexes other than via the dashboard interface. We support both these features via API.

Under the Delete index headindg in the Implementation Document it outlines the steps on how to achieve this via the API. Use the following link to access: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/

Below is a JavaScript example of how to delete an index by name.

index.delete().then(() => {
// done
});

If your requirements are to only remove the recoreds from the index you can use the clear mehtod. Under the Clear Objects heading in the Implemanation Document it outlines the steps on how to achive this via the API. Use the following link to acces: https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/clear-objects/

Below is a Javascript example of how to clear an index by name.

index.clearObjects().then(() => {
// done
});

Let me know if this answers your inquiry.

Kind regards,
Fearghal

I could not find an ehancement request forum where customers could send their enhancement request to potential modify the UI interface on the dashboard for clearing and deleting indexes.
