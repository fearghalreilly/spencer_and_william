Hey hi, I am currently trying to implement Algolia and used [one of your templates](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/tree/templates/instantsearch.js) but I can't make it work can you help me?

## Your Response

Hi Julia,

Thank you for contacting Algolia.

My name is Fearghal and will be assisting you on your inquiry regarding a solution to ensure only users can search for their own data.

You have two errors when viewing the console in the inspector tool.

Error #1:
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()

This indicates that there is a link issue with https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4/dist/instantsearchmin.js. On line 48 of the template index.html src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4.25.2 is used instead of https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4/dist/instantsearchmin.js.

Error #2:
Uncaught ReferenceError: instantsearch is not defined
at Object.parcelRequire.vZyd (app.js:8)
at f (app.8e422b25.js:1)
at parcelRequire.vZyd (app.8e422b25.js:1)
at app.8e422b25.js:1

This indicates that instantsearch hasn't been imported in app.js.

The script in error #1 looks to be pulling in the instantsearch functionality. When resolved will potentially resolve why instantsearch isn't being defined in app.js from error #2.

When inspecting app.js I noted minior variations of the codebase to what is in the app.js of the Algolia Template Code Sandbox. They are:
In the bottom of your body in the index.html you don't have any script linking to app.js at https://csb-q8x08.netlify.app/src/app.js.

On line 4 and 5 you have the API KEY and Apllication ID in reverse order as shown below

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
'API Key',
'Application ID'
);

instead of

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
'Application ID',
'API Key'
);

On line 26 you have:

container: '.brand-list',

instead of:

container: '#brand-list',

On line 34 in the Algolria Template Code Sandbox it calls the start method. This is needed to start the search as outline in the What Is InstantSearch.js? heading in the implementation documnent - https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/#a-progressive-customization-api

How did you extract the codebase from the Algolia Template Code Sandbox? Did you manually type the code, copy and paste, etc.

Kind regards,
Fearghal

## Your Comments (Optional):

#1 Errors within console tool:
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()

Uncaught ReferenceError: instantsearch is not defined
at Object.parcelRequire.vZyd (app.js:8)
at f (app.8e422b25.js:1)
at parcelRequire.vZyd (app.8e422b25.js:1)
at app.8e422b25.js:1

#2 Potentially file isn't correctly linked <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4/dist/instantsearchmin.js"></script>. Script <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/instantsearch.js@4.25.2"></script> is used in the Algolia Template Code Sandbox.

#3 Potentially in app.js they have aligoliasearch configured incorrectly with

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
'API Key',
'Application ID'
);

instead of

const searchClient = algoliasearch(
'Application ID',
'API Key'
);

#4 No search.start(); method used to execute the search in app.js. Reference https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/js/#a-progressive-customization-api

#5 Seeing how they exported and imported the code from the Algolia Template Code Sandbox into their own codebase. Might potentially indicate why their code isn't a binary equal to the template code.

#5 No mapping to the app.js in the index.html file.
