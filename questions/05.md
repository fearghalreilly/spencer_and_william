Subject: Streaming service

Hi,
We have been trying to find some solution to our problem but could not in your documentation. Basically, on our music streaming services, we want logged in users to be able to search their playlist. But to search only their playlist.

We have a "playlist" index that looks like this:

[{
"name": "Super playlist",
"user_id": 234
}, {
"name": "NYE playlist",
"user_id": 345
}]

Right now we are able to use the "filter" option of Algolia but it's not super secure since any user can change the parameter and access every other user playlist. What can we do to ensure users are only able to search their own playlist and not all of them?

Thanks.

## Your Response

Hi Stan,

Thank you for contacting Algolia.

My name is Fearghal and will be assisting you on your inquiry regarding a solution to ensure only users can search for their own data.

The use of User Restricted Access to Data is a solution for your inquirements. Refer to the User Restricted Access to Data implemenation guide - https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/security/api-keys/how-to/user-restricted-access-to-data/#adding-an-attribute-for-filtering-in-your-dataset

User Restricted Access to Data prevents sensitive attributes being unretreiable even if the response is inspected. The unretrievableAttributes parameter ensures that the visable_by paramaet in never part of the Algolia response, even though you use it for filtering on the engine side.

Let me know if this resolves your inquiry.

Kind regards,
Fearghal
