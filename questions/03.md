## Your Response

Hi Marc,

Thank you for contacting Algolia.

My name is Fearghal and will be assisting you on your inquiry regarding why you receive the error outlined in the attached document when you access your website.

When getting an "Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined ", it indicates that there is an non-existent variable referenced somewhere in your codebase. This variable needs to be declared, or you need to make sure it is avaiable in your current script.

When reviewing the attached document, it looks that you are using searchkit. The error is indicating that you have not imported it. If you have imported it, move the library to the beginning of all your scripts and retest. Refer to the following link on the installation of a library. - https://community.algolia.com/algoliasearch-helper-js/gettingstarted.html#integrate.

Let me know if this resolves your inquiry. If it hasnâ€™t, can you provide the following information:

Were you able to access your website in the past without receiving this error?
If you were, when did you start receiving this error when accessing your website?
Have you implemented any configuration changes since then?
What is the hyperlink to your website?

Kind regards,
Fearghal

I checked the implemenation document and no reference of searchkit. The closest reference of searchkit is searchhit. The customer is potentially using searchkit instead of searchhit. https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/how-to/flutter/android/#prepare-a-platform-channel

If the pruposed solution doesn't work, I will use the time frame for when it potentially last worked as expected to identify the potential configuration that was added that may have caused this error.
